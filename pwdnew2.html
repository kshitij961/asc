<h1>2.Thanksgiving Getaways: Where to Go for Thanksgiving 2020</h1>
<h3>New York City, New York</h3>

<p>The Big Apple is a classic Thanksgiving destination best associated with the annual Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade. This year because of the ongoing pandemic, parade organizers have dramatically altered the format. Thankfully the tradition will continue; however, it will not be the same parade. At the time of writing, Macy’s has not yet announced final details. What is known is that the performances and activities will be spread out to allow for adequate physical distancing. If you’re planning to travel to New York for Thanksgiving, you can forego trying to wedge yourself into the crowds along Central Park West or 6th Avenue. Instead, get into the holiday spirit by visiting those other iconic landmarks that make New York City such a wonderful destination. Do some shopping in SoHo or take a lovely walk through Central Park. Museum hours will vary depending on the location so make sure to check ahead on this front. Given the paucity of tourists coming in, hotels around New York are offering fairly good deals. Search around a bit and chances are you might find something you wouldn’t normally consider. Also give yourself a chance to explore outside of Manhattan. There’s a lot going on in Brooklyn and Queens these days. Now is a good time to visit New York City.</p>
<h3>Orlando, Florida</h3>

<p>Disney World no doubt comes to mind when one hears mention of Orlando. While the famous park is certainly a draw, it’s far from the only reason this city is an attractive Thanksgiving destination. To be sure, you’ll want to book ahead and look for Disney deals online as a way to cut down on entrance fees. Same goes for Universal Studios. Don’t neglect a visit to Downtown Orlando, where you can find some wonderful recreation and places to enjoy the Florida sun. Visit Lake Eola Park or one of the city’s many other greenspaces. Orlando’s diverse restaurants and local eateries are a testament to its proud counterculture tradition. The city has long welcomed LGBTQ community members and boasts a strong civic pride. The Orlando Science Center and the Mennello Museum of American Art anchor an exciting set of civic institutions that provide a cost effective alternative to shelling out for the big amusement parks. At the very least they’re a great addition to a couple of days spent at Disney and Universal Studios. Another popular thing to do is head over to Cape Canaveral. Explore the Space Coast and tour the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex. You will need to purchase your tickets online and in advance. This is a great destination for the whole family with lots of excellent exhibits profiling the history of the US space program.</p>
<h3>Hawaii</h3>

<p>Hawaii is America’s tropical paradise and traditionally, Thanksgiving is outside the state’s peak travel season. Prospective visitors will find this an advantageous time to scout for deals on various hotels and attractions. Lush green landscapes, black volcanic beaches, and world class surf breaks sound fantastic any time of year. Destinations in Hawaii are served by most US domestic air carriers as well as many foreign carriers. The capital Honolulu has the state’s largest airport and will offer the best options. One thing that’s different now is the requirement that arriving passengers carry proof of a negative test result for COVID-19. Travelers who have not been tested are obliged to undergo a 14-day quarantine. Tests should be performed by approved testing providers and must be a so-called PCR test. Antigen tests that detect previous exposure to COVID-19 are not sufficient. Once you get to Hawaii you’ll have your choice of amazing adventures including searching out waterfalls on Kaua’i, whale watching off Maui, urban excitement in Honolulu, or hunting for volcanoes on the Big Island. With a well-developed tourist infrastructure and easy connections to the mainland and cities abroad, Hawaii is the ideal getaway. If it’s not a destination you would normally consider during Thanksgiving, 2020 might just be the year you change things up a bit.</p>
