<p>Halloween 2020 falls on a Saturday. Saturday, October 31 to be precise. This year, rather than being forced to celebrate earlier in order to accommodate work and school schedules, you can enjoy the festivities on the actual night itself. Not being an official bank holiday, Halloween traditionally does not come with any time off. Some businesses may close early to allow employees a chance to enjoy themselves. However, this is the exception, certainly not the rule.</p>
<h2>Spooky Getaways for Halloween 2020</h2>

<p>The “Big Easy” is no stranger to a great Halloween party. Having already perfected Mardi Gras, there’s a similar tradition and revelry surrounding Halloween. Long a place where cultures blend, New Orleans is world-renowned for its distinct music, Creole heritage, and festival scene. As the birthplace of Louis Armstrong, the city swells with an enormous sense of pride. The Creole imports go beyond delicious cuisine and music, they also include the oft-maligned and misunderstood voodoo religious traditions. Capitalizing on the more sensationalized (and bastardized) aspects, New Orleans is home to many a shop, tourist attraction, and museum featuring zombies, spooks, and voodoo dolls. Though fun for Halloween, voodoo has a long and storied history among Afro-Caribbean peoples extending far beyond the notions of possession and spirits. Do yourself a favor and link up with a tour that will help you explore the true meaning of voodoo culture. Another popular Halloween activity is to visit the city’s famous cemeteries. Given its location and high groundwater table, New Orleans has long had to bury its dead aboveground. The city’s famous final resting places are popular on Halloween and include the historic Greenwood Cemetery. Spend some time wandering around the elaborate sarcophagi, but be on the lookout in case the Bone Man comes calling. Finish out the night in the famed French Quarter.</p>
<p><strong>Salem, MA</strong></p>

<p>The legacy of Salem, Massachusetts is inextricably bound up with the events that occurred in 1692 and later became known as the Salem Witch Trials. The episode of puritanical mass hysteria resulted in hundreds of accusations, 30 convictions, and at least 19 directly related executions. Today, the town commemorates this dark chapter with several memories and museums dedicated to shining a light on exactly what occurred and why. Given their association with Halloween, Salem’s connection to witches and witchcraft make it a perennially popular destination. Located roughly 30 minutes north of Boston, you can easily make Salem into a daytrip or part of a longer vacation along the Massachusetts coast. Consider, for example, a fall driving tour that takes you up from Boston to Salem, on to Manchester-by-the-Sea, and finally towards Gloucester. These stunning areas are full of the Old World charms on offer throughout New England. In Salem itself, make sure to visit the Witch House, the Witch Dungeon Museum, and Salem Witch Museum, and the Salem Witch Village. All are located within convenient access of the waterfront so it’s easy to make your way around town on foot. There’s normally plenty of Halloween-related activities and promotions on offer in Salem. This is one place you won’t be lacking for things to enjoy.</p>
<p><strong>Sleepy Hollow, NY</strong></p>

<p>When asked, school-aged children can likely recall the harrowing story of Ichabod Crane. The protagonist in Washington Irving’s classic The Legend of Sleepy Hollow was portrayed by the dashing Johnny Depp in Tim Burton’s 1999 film adaptation. In Irving’s original tale, Crain is vividly described as a slightly comical-looking schoolmaster with a tender heart. Venturing home late one night, Crane encounters the legendary Headless Horseman, a frightful apparition who pursues Crain through Sleepy Hollow. Irving’s penchant for storytelling leaves readers with a memorable impression. The real Sleepy Hollow is a charming little town set on the Eastern Bank of the Hudson River roughly an hour’s drive north from Lower Manhattan. In fact, you could hop on Broadway at Times Square and take it all the way to Sleepy Hollow. Once there, you can explore the lovely small town and visit the Sleepy Hollow Lighthouse, Philipsburg Manor, and the gorgeous Sleepy Hollow itself. The densely wooded area is filled with many lovely paths and open fields. Wander through Sleepy Hollow cemetery where you will find Washington Irving’s grave along with that of Andrew Carnegie and William Rockefeller. Flee towards town as darkness draws nigh and make sure you’re across the Headless Horseman Bridge with plenty of time to spare. This is a frighteningly good Halloween destination.</p>
<p><strong>Estes Park, CO</strong></p>

<p>Here’s Johnny!” Anyone old enough to remember Jack Nicholson’s bone-chilling performance in Stanley Kubrick’s The Shining can readily attest to the film’s cultural impact. Kubrick’s films always explored the outer reaches of the human psyche and Nicholson’s onscreen descent into madness was visceral. The film was an adaptation of Stephen King’s novel of the same name. King found inspiration for the novel’s location in the Stanley Hotel in Estes Park, Colorado. Offering spectacular panoramic views of Lake Estes and the nearby Rocky Mountain peaks, the Stanley Hotel is an absolute classic. Estes Park itself serves at the gateway into nearby Rocky Mountain National Park. A UNESCO-designated World Biosphere Reserve, Rocky Mountain National Park contains a multitude of species, scenic hiking trails, river recreation, phenomenal camping, and more. Particularly now when safe and affordable vacation destinations are scarce, you’ll find the wide-open spaces a welcome relief from months of pent-up coronavirus-induced frustrations. In addition to a smattering of dining and drinking options, Estes Park has a few art galleries specializing in works dedicated to Rocky Mountain imagery. You’ll also find the smallish Fun City amusement park featuring a go-kart track and miniature golf. Treat yourself with a stay at the Stanley Hotel and you’ll have a Halloween to remember.</p>

<p>This holiday season, the best way to ensure a good time for you and your family is to plan early. Don’t wait until the last minute to make your travel arrangements. This year, it’s even more important to know what challenges you may face and how you want to deal with them. For example, make sure to find out whether the destination you plan to visit has any special quarantine requirements / recommendations for travelers. The same goes for your own state and locality during the return trip. If you plan to have friends and family over to your house, consult with them ahead of time regarding your own personal pandemic safety precautions. Do you expect your guests to wear masks? Is there a member of your family who might refuse to abide by your guidelines? Have you decided how you might handle any awkward interactions? Developing a plan or some basic strategies will go a long way towards making your holiday season more reminiscent of the carefree time we all remember from not so long ago.</p>
