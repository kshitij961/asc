    <p>Religion has long played a central role in the human experience. Organized religion has existed in one form or another from the very dawn of civilization. No matter what one thinks about particular claims made by a specific faith, it is impossible to argue against religion’s importance. Billions of people today organize their lives around religious teachings and consider a variety of places around the world sacred. We’ve put together this list of the world’s most important religious sites. Though necessarily incomplete, these locations are intangible cultural treasures. These are nine of the most important religious sites on Earth.</p>
    <h3>Saint Peter’s Basilica, Vatican City (Catholicism)  </h3>

    <p>Saint Peter’s Basilica in Vatican City is the world’s largest church. Designed in part by Michelangelo, it is the finest example of Renaissance architecture in existence. Despite not actually being the highest ranking Catholic Cathedral (a distinction held by the Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran in Rome), Saint Peter’s is often regarded as the greatest church in Christendom. The magnificent artwork on display is breathtaking. Standing near Bernini’s baldachin as sunbeams appear to drop down from heaven is nothing short of aweinspring. Separate from the tour through the Vatican Museums and the Sistine Chapel, visitors can explore Saint Peter’s Basilica by itself; however, you most certainly want to see all of these extraordinary sites. Plan to spend at least a full day at Vatican City.</p>
    <h3>Western Wall, Jerusalem (Judaism)</h3>

    <p>Judaism’s holiest site is the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, where the Second Temple stood until it was destroyed in 70 CE. The temple’s western retaining wall is preserved from this time and is regarded as the most important place to gather and pray. Jewish religious decrees currently forbid the faithful from entering the Temple Mount itself in part to prevent Jews from unknowingly walking through the Holy of Holies. The large open plaza on the top of Temple Mount is dominated by the Dome of the Rock and the Al-Aqsa Mosque, themselves among the most significant religious sites in Islam. According to Israeli occupation authorities, visitors are permitted on Temple Mount provided it is not closed for security reasons. Only muslims are allowed to openly pray on the site. Non-muslims observed engaging in prayer are subject to expulsion.</p>
    <h3>Great Mosque of Mecca, Saudi Arabia (Islam)</h3>

    <p>Islamic tradition holds that the faithful should pray five times per day while facing the Kaaba, a cube-like structure located at the center of the Great Mosque in Mecca. Considered by muslims to be the earthy house of God, the Kaaba and the Great Mosque surroudning it are the holiest places in Islam. Once during their lifetime, all muslims who are able are expected to perform the annual Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. Expanded over the centuries, the Great Mosque is today the world’s largest. It also contains the Well of Zamzam, thought to be a divine source of water. Non-muslim visitors are not permitted to enter the city of Mecca on penelty of fine or deportation from Saudi Arabia. The city of Medina to the north is open to visitors and contains the Islam’s second holiest site, the mosque housing the prophet Muhammad’s tomb.</p>
    <h3>Church of the Holy Sepulchre, Jerusalem (Christianity)</h3>

    <p>Located in Jerusalem’s Christian Quarter, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre is regarded by most Christian denominations to contain the faith’s two holiest sites: the place where Jesus was crucified and the tomb where he was buried and resurrected. Both locations were historically in the open, only later was the church constructed to contain them. Each year scores of pilgrims journey to the site, especially during Holy Week leading up to Easter Sunday. According to tradition, the last four so-called Stations of the Cross occurred within the contemporary church walls. An ornate Altar of the Crucifixion sits upon the rock where Jesus is said to have died. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre is open daily. There is no admission fee; however, be prepared to wait in line if crowds are large.</p>
