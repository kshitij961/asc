    <p>There’s plenty going on deep in the heart of Texas. San Antonio is a lovely travel destination that won’t break your bank account. Here you will find heaps of Texas culture and a vast array of great attractions. The relatively compact city center affords ample opportunity to string together several stops. Start at the famous Alamo, the historic garrison and pivotal battleground during the Texas Revolution in 1836. Since that time, the Alamo has become a potent symbol used by generations of Texans to proclaim their identity. Walk to the nearby Buckhorn Saloon & Museum where you can have a drink at this Old West-themed gift shop. From there it’s easy to enjoy San Antonio’s River Walk, a charming landscaped green space winding past numerous restaurants, hotels, and bridges.</p>

    <p>Located a few hours south of Mexico City, Puebla is a wonderful town with strong colonial-era ties. In addition to being a renowned destination for mole, Puebla boasts incredible architecture and beautiful scenery. Unlike other colonial-era cities in Mexico, Puebla was founded by the Spanish upon their arrival. Elsewhere in Mexico, colonial authorities built upon existing structures and urban developments. This was not the case in Puebla. The rich legacy makes it a great destination for budget-minded travelers. Start in the Zócalo de Puebla. The vibrant public square features fountains and benches and is surrounded by delicious restaurants. Visit the Catedral de Puebla just opposite the Zócalo. This Roman Catholic cathedral contains a fascinating octagonal alter. From here you have easy access to Puebla’s commercial district where you can browse for bargains or hunt for a souvenir.</p>
    <h2>3.Hawaii, USA</h2>

    <p>Hawaii is America’s tropical paradise. Lush green landscapes, black volcanic beaches, world class surf breaks…it’s an all-around ideal destination. Ascend Mauna Kea or dive amongst the ship wrecks on O’ahu. Hang Ten on the North Shore or head into Honolulu for some great shopping and dining. Whatever your passions, you can scratch the itch in Hawaii. On the western side of Kaua’i Island you will find Waimea Canyon State Park. Known to many as the “Grand Canyon of the Pacific,” Waimea was carved over centuries by rainwater runoff from Mount Waiʻaleʻale. Among the wettest places on Earth, the mountain feeds Waimea’s innumerable waterfalls. Come see the reddish soils and green vegetation set against azure blue skies. It will leave you with the memories of a lifetime. Visit Pearl Harbor National Memorial, see the remains of the USS Arizona, and tour the decommissioned USS Missouri. Along O’ahu’s northern shores are famous surf breaks including Sunset Beach and Banzai Pipeline. This is the place that put the big in big wave riding. Head to the Big Island and visit Hawaiʻi Volcanoes National Park.</p>
    <h2>4.Brisbane, Australia</h2>

    <p>Australia, the Land Down Under, is a vast continent full of rich biodiversity, incredible culture, and untamed wilderness. The Australian Outback is the stuff of legend. Running along the country’s eastern coast is the Great Barrier Reef, the world’s largest coral reef system. Brisbane, capital of Queensland, is a place to enjoy lots of Australian experiences without overloading your wallet. Start in Central Brisbane at the Brisbane City Botanic Gardens. Enjoy a walk in the lovely park set long the banks of the Brisbane River. Cross Goodwill Bridge and visit the Queensland Maritime Museum. Grab something to eat at one of the cafes and restaurants along the river before dropping by Streets Beach for some fun and relaxation.

    <p>India has long fascinated travelers. The country’s incredible heritage and dizzying pace make it a wonderful destination. Immense and diverse, it can be hard to know where to go or what to see. If you’re a budget-minded traveler looking to maximize your excitement and adventure, we recommend heading for the northern city of Agra. Located in India’s most-populous state, Uttar Pradesh, Agra is where you will find that most recognizable Indian landmark, the Taj Mahal. If you’re traveling by train, book your ticket to Agra Fort station, which is conveniently located near many of the city’s important sights. Wander the labyrinthine streets to acquaint yourself with the local culture before heading to Agra Fort, the former residence for emperors during the Mughal Dynasty. A UNESCO World Heritage Site, the fort’s historical significance make it a must-see attraction. Be sure to see the monumental Delhi Gate, considered an architectural marvel when it was built. Wander the fort and gain an appreciation for how Mughal royalty lived. Walk through Taj Garden and Mumtaz Park on your way to the Taj Mahal.</p>
