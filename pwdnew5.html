<p>A small town located in the Wanaka Lake District, Wanaka is less than 100 km from Queenstown and is considered the premier destination for tourism and holiday outside Queenstown. Here you can experience a wide range of outdoor activities such as skydiving, flying, hiking, cycling, skiing, etc. You can also quietly enjoy the lakeside scenery in the cafe by the lake. The town is dominated by outdoor activities and there are not many conventional attractions, the most famous of which is Puzzling World, the only theme park in the world full of quirky content. There is a house of illusion that subverts your sight, there are Roman toilets that are confusing and inscrutable, as well as a huge two-story maze that is with a total length of 1.5 kilometers. It is very suitable for family vacations.</p>
