The canyon is divided into three parts, south, west and north. Although the North Rim is closed by snow on roads in winter, the West Rim and South Rim are still open (the South Rim is generally recommended). Part of the landscape is covered by snow, showing a clear shaped beauty. There are fewer people visiting the Grand Canyon compared to summer, and it's a great time to enjoy the scenery quietly.

There are many plants and animals in Zion, which has a beautiful landscape. It you want to see the beautiful scenery of Zion National Park, you can only walk.

When you get to the top, you will have a sigh of relief and enjoy the view like an emperor. White snow covered with red rocks is under the foot. The stream winds along the mountain. It is very worthwhile to see the scenery (if there is a lot of snow, it is not recommended to walk including children, the elderly and people with high phobia climbing). As the winter in Zion is also warm, so there is no snow blocking the road. Even if it snows, there will be snow shovels to clean up, Even in the coldest January, the lowest temperature is about - 67℃, which is very suitable for hiking.</p>
